Simple To-Do List in Python:
                            This is a beginner-friendly To-Do List app built using Python.  
                            It runs in the terminal and helps you add, view, and delete tasks easily.

How It Works?
                 1. The program shows you a menu:
                                            - Add Task
                                            - View Tasks
                                            - Delete Task
                                            - Exit  
                 2. You enter a number (1â€“4) to choose what to do.
                 3. The task list is saved in memory while the program is running.
                 4. You can keep adding or removing tasks until you choose to exit.
